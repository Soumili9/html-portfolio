<h1>The Best Movies According to Soumili</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Life of Pi</h3>
<p>
Ang Lee's "Life of Pi" is a miraculous achievement of storytelling and a landmark of visual mastery. 
Inspired by a worldwide best-seller that many readers must have assumed was unfilmable,it is a 
triumph over its difficulties. It is also a moving spiritual achievement, a movie whose title could
have been shortened to "life".<br/>"Life of Pi" is all real, second by second and minute by minute,
and what it finally amounts to is left for every viewer to decide.
I have decided it as one of the best films.

<h3>The Lesson</h3>
<p>
Early on in this dreary would-be psychological thriller, the literary mandarin J.M. Sinclair, 
played by Richard Grant, shares with an interviewer his observations on the writing life. 
When all the dominoes fall, it's so neat, so pat; there's no credibility, and with that gone,
any opportunity for emotional resonance goes perfect as well. Some might expect this picture 
to be redeemed by juicy performances, but that's not the case; while none of the performers
phone it in, the script gives them only the most commonplace ideas and states to convey.<br/> 
“The Lesson” is a wash.<br/>
Now playing in theaters.

<h3>The General</h3>
<p>
Consider an opening sequence in "The General” (1927),its a masterpiece about a Southern
railway engineer who has "only two loves in his life” -- his locomotive and the beautiful
Annabelle Lee.
